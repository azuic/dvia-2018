## Planning on Mapping Time Project

##### Some ideas
1. Average noise level shown as soundwaves to indicate time 
- need streaming data on noise levels and API to extract real time values
2. NYC Taxi Traffic flow based on TLC data (used before)
- too much data points, computational consuming

##### Back to P5.js
###### Build a revolving clock
1. Idea came from the revolution of the earth and the moon to represent time
2. From inside revolving circles to outside, each rotation represent second, minute, hour, day, month, year/season (TBD)
3. Each inner circle will be a position on the outer circle
4. See sketch for a more detailed draft
